My private little Node based media converter.
Use convert-to-webp to optimize images from PNG, JPG, and JPEG to WebP.
Use convert-gif-to-MP4 to optimize GIFs to MP4.

npm install - requires Sharp
Requires FFMpeg to be downloaded and installed globally.

- For windows : https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- extract the zip file and add the path to the bin folder to your system's PATH variable.
  - Now you can run the gif to mp4 script from anywhere in your terminal :)
